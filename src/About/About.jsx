          I really love frontend development because it feels like drawing with
          codeâ€”like creating art on the web. This is why I'm passionate about
          frontend development; it allows me to bring creative visions to life
          and build interactive experiences that users can enjoy.

          Web development is my chosen career path after transitioning from the
          field of aeronautical science. I shifted my focus to this dynamic
          and creative industry to explore new technological frontiers and
          leverage my problem-solving skills in a rapidly evolving digital
          landscape.
